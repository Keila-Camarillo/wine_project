    "# Project Description\n",
    "We will be analyzing, factors that affect wine quality. Our objective is to build a predictive model that can estimate the quality of a given wine. The focus here is to gain insights and understanding about the factors influencing wine quality rather than generating practical predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will be analyzing, exploring the different attributes affecting red and white wine quality. \n",
    "* We will be creating a model based on to predict the quality of the wine.\n",
    "* This data would not be used on future properties or for real life prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial hypothesis for this project is that certain factors such as 'area', 'bathrooms', 'year', 'pool', 'bedroom', 'fips', and 'year' may be significant drivers of property value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Acquire\n",
    "* Aquire dataset from Codeup database\n",
    "* It contained 52,442 rows and 7 columns before cleaning\n",
    "* Each row represents a property at Zillow\n",
    "* Each column represents a feature of those properties\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prepare\n",
    "- Prepare Actions:\n",
    "    * Filtered columns that did not contain useful information\n",
    "    * Renamed columns to promote readability\n",
    "    * Checked for nulls in the data. The following columns contained nulls:\n",
    "        - 'pool' (41,346 nulls), nulls changed to 0\n",
    "        - 'year' (116 nulls), these rows were dropped  \n",
    "        - 'area' (82 nulls), these rows were dropped  \n",
    "        - 'property_value' (1 null), these rows were dropped  \n",
    "    * Checked that column data types were appropriate\n",
    "    * Added full_bath column, which divides the type of bathrooms into homes with only full bathrooms and half bathrooms and including one home that has a three-quarters bath.\n",
    "    * Encoded categorical variables\n",
    "    * Split data into train, validate and test (approx. 60/20/20)\n",
    "    * 2,641 outliers have been removed for the iteration of the project, based on if they fell outside the 3 standard deviation"
