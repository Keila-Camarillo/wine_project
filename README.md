# Project Goals:
We would be analyzing, exploring the different attributes affecting red and white wine quality. 
We would be creating a model based on to predict the quality of the wine.
This data would not be used on future properties or for real life prediction.

# Project description:
For this project we would exploring the different factors that affect wine quality.
Some of these factors are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, pH, alcohol levels, etc. Focusing on these factors, it would help us identify and predict wine quality. 
# Project planning:
1. Planning:  During this process we asked ourselves important questions about the project, and the division of task among team members. Data planning will be shown in this readme.
2. Acquisition: Data was acquired from data.world published by food.Raw data would be downloaded and a csv for red and white wine data set has been created which would be use to pull the data during this project.
3. Preparation:The red and wine datas would be combines into one dataframe, clean and prepared for exploration.Nulls were handled accordingly and quality assurance was practiced to ensure the validity of each attribute. A column to identify red and white one was created and encoded for moedeling purposes. Outliers were dropped and handled accordingly, and columns were renamed for better identification.
